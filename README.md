## Overview

This project aimed to provide valuable insights to a client interested in investing in the vacation rental market in Manhattan, New York City. Through meticulous data analysis of Airbnb listings, this project aimed to guide the client in targeting the most lucrative properties for future investment.

Reviewed NYC Airbnb dataset and documented data cleaning steps. Filtered listings based on relevance, focusing on short-term rentals with a maximum 7-day stay requirement and active reviews. Prioritized neighborhoods based on popularity, which was based on review count over one year, and identified property sizes most suitable for vacation rentals. Utilized pivot tables for data aggregation and visualization to recommend specific property types for good investments in each neighborhood. Aggregated calendar data to determine occupancy rates and understand rental trends. Incorporated prices and average occupancy rates to provide realistic revenue projections. Explored the impact on property performance by factors such as superhost status, instant booking, and amenity options. Employed pivot tables and bar graphs to identify correlations between various attributes and rental success. Organized data, documented assumptions, and formatted spreadsheets for clarity and professionalism. Included an Executive Summary sheet for a concise overview of recommendations.
